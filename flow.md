### Multiple scattering - EXAFS fourier transform?

do exafs - validate off titanium @Quantum

make interactive pluto notebook with undulator and monochromator on slider, reporducing flux example?



#### Deconvolve 




Calculate:

From beam emittance and 
undulator K / travel and grating movement over spectrum
