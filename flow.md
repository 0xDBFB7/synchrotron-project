### Multiple scattering - EXAFS fourier transform?

write a Real Space Multiple Scattering code

off-the-shelf codes like FEFF are not used for didactic reasons.

dose-dependence of some photoreductive 

do exafs - validate off titanium @Quantum

make interactive pluto notebook with undulator and monochromator on slider, reporducing flux cal graph?

integrity checker - checks if data is plausible like retraction

deconvolve actual VLS output spectrum 




Calculate:

From beam emittance and 
undulator K / travel and grating movement over spectrum
