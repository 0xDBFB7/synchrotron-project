# [A few notes on deconvolution of XAFS spectra](https://github.com/0xDBFB7/synchrotron-project/raw/main/paper.pdf)

Daniel Correia

> An ostensibly more noise-tolerant deconvolution algorithm is (poorly)
implemented in Larch; results are not clearly superior. Real-world
results from the VLS-PGM are re-processed and yield useable fidelity.
An interface to the existing inverse filtering deconvolution is added
to demeter/Athena. Non-stationary kernels are discussed.
