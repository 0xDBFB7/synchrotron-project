In keeping with the norms of all mediocre papers, we will provide an introduction which is too vague and devoid of detail for the beginner, but completely useless for the expert.

XAS, XANES, EAXS, with the aim of developing a fingerprint. 
The methods vary in methods of quanification and detection (directly detecting X-ray absorption, re-emitted fluroescence or luminescence spectra, or ), 
and each provide information with a different surface depth, feature scale and periodicity.
All rely on the same waveform: different orders of scattering, 

same overarching paradigm @Multiplescattering1986

core holes (which, it should be noted, )


it was hoped that I would be able to produce a XANES using the RSGF


Fourier-transform-based EXAFS appears to be much more straightforward to implement than the other parts of the alphabet soup.
Unlike ab-initio It makes assumptions based on the 

prototype in python, then port to C++ to align with the existing CERN ROOT beamline code 

we want to do the inverse problem: given an input spectrum  create a synthetic

Part or all of the research described in this paper was performed at the Canadian Light Source, a national research facility of the University of Saskatchewan, which is supported by the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), the National Research Council (NRC), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Government of Saskatchewan, and the University of Saskatchewan.

....and then ack the specific beamline
