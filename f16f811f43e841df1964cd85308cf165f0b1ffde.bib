  note = {I appreciate the excellent work that CSIS does to protect our country from bad actors; securing technologies important to national security, and protecting the hard-earned intellectual property of companies.
\par
However, I wonder if the "Safeguarding your Research" page may not be balanced appropriately for modern scientific audiences. I take particular issue with the inclusion of the line item "Academia" and the CLS in the Saskathewan regional factsheets. I can understand that, as a security-focused organization, but I believe there must be a more clear deliniation between the cultures of academia and 
\par
this may seem like a trivial detail, but this "blurring of boundaries" has lead to several high-profile failures in the U.S.
\par
The CLS is funded between 90 to 95\% by global scientific effort, only \textasciitilde 5\% from industry, yet it produces a 3 to 1 return on investment to Canada's GDP. That ROI is only achievable if the scientific results it produces are disseminated freely.
\par
Moreover, the canadian light source is a patchwork of what this document may well call "espionage". It uses a Russian wiggler design; the chief officer was pilfered from the European synchrotron; and most of the control software was borrowed from
\par
Reluctance to completely openly share research data has led to several scandals as of late, and in the modern context I must argue leads to a much greater "tarnishing of reputation" than any (non-PII) breach could. journal editorial standards~
\par
"The government, business, \textbf{\emph{and academic} }communities have a shared interest in increasing awareness of state-sponsored espionage targeting Canada to mitigate the potential negative impact on our economic growth and ability to innovate"
\par
As a tax payer in Canada, I would like that the workers I fund are encouraged - if not \emph{mandated,~}as researchers in many countries are - to fully share the detailed results of their research. I am very glad to see that the page stresses that publication guidelines should be followed, but mere "bare minimum" publication is no good.
\par
\emph{Identify your most valuable information and protect it \_ don’t share unless essential.}
\par
Contrast all the guidance given in the document - especially that on software, with the Canadian government's own mandates:
\par
The Directive on Management of IT support the Digital Standard \#3: \emph{Working in the open by default,} via \href{https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249&section=procedure&p=C}{Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture Assessment (C2.3.8)}.
\par
I want employees to take extraordinary interest

"Canada recognizes the importance of Open Science as a driver for greater innovation and inclusion in research and development."
\par
smells of
\par
this proprietariness~ is only exacerbated by current funding atmospheres.
\par
We are in the midst of a so-called reproducibility crisis in science, partly because most publications do not contain sufficient detail to be useful, and it can be argued that at least in part because of rampant fears of "stolen research".
\par
at the same time, a renessance is occuring; open science. it is being acknowledged.},
