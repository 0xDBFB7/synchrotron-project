Notes on deconvolution of XAS spectra.


A deconvolution interface is contributed to Demeter; a more noise-tolerant algorithm is added to Larch. Non-stationary kernels are discussed.

circumstances are probably rather rare

it seems more episemologically robust to use an inherently higher-resolution technique then to try to extract. 


COnvolve and noise and deconvolve and see which one is a more accurate representation!!!!
rather than using existing unknown core-hole

In papers describing the VLS-PGM and similar beamlines, the "resolving power" of the system 

This resolving power seems to mostly reflect the quality of the output spectrum of the monochromator.

Purely for amusement, the question arose of what the ultimate resolving power would be if, and how corrections can be implemented.

An X-ray spectrum observed from experiment represents the convolution of many different sources of error, tabulated by 

For argon this is perhaps 1 eV, and can reach 

Excellent discussion can be found in [@XRay1991], particularly chapters 4.5.3, Chapter 4.7, X-ray line width

These widths vary

# Non-stationary, or varying, 

One impediement to ultimate resolution, especially in the case of the VLS-PGM, is the non-flatness of the 


in practice, segments of spectrum requiring  ultra-high-resolution are hardly likely to be longer than a few tens of eV, so the variation in spectrum doesn't seem likely
