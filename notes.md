RF power is produced by a "thermionic" generator. What is that? Klystron?

# Stats

Branch A has a ~0.3 mm beam width.

Branch B has a new KB focus system

> Typically, the duration of a 25eV scan is ~20 minutes


# Resolving power

VLS-PGM stands for Variable Line Spacing Plane Grating Monochromator.

[@zuin2007early] describes the VLS-PGM beamline, and mentions that it has a "resolving power" of $10^4$. 

What does resolving power mean? [@XRay1991], page 311, chapter 9.5. 

This refers to the use of a plane crystal spectrograph. How does that relate to the VGS?

> The angular dispersion is different from the *resolving power*, $\lambda / d\lambda$, or *resolution*.

$\lambda / d\lambda = E/|dE|$

# Qs to be answered

#### what's the energy in this x-ray beam? 

Flux is between $10^12$ and $10^15$ photons/sec depending on 

#### does the target get thermally damaged? Is ionization damage a serious concern?

#### Is the beam pulsed?

I don't see any provisions on the control panel for pulsed operation. There is a provision for a basic kind of synchronization. The beam is split into bunches.

#### what's the detector usually?

1. Si photodiode that monitors the flux.
2. There's a 

#### Is the input to the monochromator to the VLS-PGM from an insertion device or from the storage ring bremmsstralung alone?

There are 12 straight sections in the beamline with dipole bending magnets at the corners. Wouldn't be any bremsstralung from the straight sections, presumably.
