RF power is produced by a "thermionic" generator. What is that? Klystron?


# Resolving power

[@zuin2007early] describes the VLS-PGM beamline, and mentions that it has a "resolving power" of $10^4$. 

What does resolving power mean? [@XRay1991], page 311, chapter 9.5. 

This refers to the use of a plane crystal spectrograph. How does that relate to the VGS?

> The angular dispersion is different from the *resolving power*, $\lambda / d\lambda$, or *resolution*.

$\lambda / d\lambda = E/|dE|$

# Qs to be answered

what's the energy in this x-ray beam? does the target get thermally damaged? is it pulsed?
what's the detector?
