RF power is produced by a "thermionic" generator. What is that? Klystron?

# Stats

Branch A has a ~0.3 mm beam width.

Branch B has a new KB focus system

> Typically, the duration of a 25eV scan is ~20 minutes

CLS is a "third generation" source.

# Resolving power

VLS-PGM stands for Variable Line Spacing Plane Grating Monochromator.

[@zuin2007early] describes the VLS-PGM beamline, and mentions that it has a "resolving power" of $10^4$. 

What does resolving power mean? [@XRay1991], page 311, chapter 9.5. 

> The angular dispersion is different from the *resolving power*, $\lambda / d\lambda$, or *resolution*.

$\lambda / d\lambda = E/|dE|$

I believe this means the energy setpoint divided by "the smallest FWHM seen in a spectrum".
one source stated a smallest FWHM of 1.5 milli-eV 

# Qs to be answered

#### what's the energy in this x-ray beam? 

Flux is between $10^12$ and $10^15$ photons/sec.

#### does the target get thermally damaged? 

The power on M1 after the undulator is almost 500 W! 



#### Why are three gratings used to span the wavelength range rather than two on other light sources?

#### Shouldn't a grating monochromator have higher order modes, which would let the background bremnsstralung from distant bending dipole get through? How are these filtered out?



#### Is ionization damage/dislocation on the target a concern?

Yes! @close2015 calls for better reporting standardization, as total dose can affect results. I'm not sure that CLS mentioned total dose as a reporting variable - might perhaps be an interesting method. They also state that, since the beam spot size has decreased, increased. They also state that in Cryo EM, 

Radiation-induced dislocations don't seem to occur at these wavelengths. 

Possible research question: what effect does radiation dose have on <example study>, and how will these effects be increased with the new beamline?



#### Is the beam pulsed? Are XAS techniques ever pulsed?

I don't see any provisions on the control panel for pulsed operation. There is a provision for a basic kind of synchronization. The beam is split into bunches.

#### What detectors do the VLS-PGM beamlines have?

1. Si photodiode that monitors the flux.
2. QEPro USB4000 UV-Vis spectrometer (for luminescence [XEOL] measurement)

> VLS-PGM's Toroidal Spectrometer apparatus measures the angle, energy, and relative drift time of ions and electrons generated by the ionization of molecules by soft X-rays.
> @Recent2014 

>The first is a dual toroid electrostatic particle energy analyser. Each toroid can (independently) measure the energy and angular distribution of charged particles emitted from the interaction region and can be set for either positive ions or electrons. This allows both photoelectron and ion kinetic energy spectra to be recorded. Recent results from this instrument will be presented including both high resolution photoelectron spectra and photoelectron asymmetry parameter (β) spectra. Coincidence circuitry exists to allow, in favourable circumstances,the measurement of molecular frame photoelectron angular distributions (MFPADs) where the detection of an ion fragment allows orientation of the parent molecule to be deduced. The second is a Wiley-McLaren Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer equipped with multihit electronics. This allows partial ion yield (PIY) spectra to be recorded as well as multi-ion coincidence spectra (PePIPICO). Again recent results will be presented looking at double ionisation in benzene like molecules.

#### What detector is usually used for XAS?


#### What material is the VLS-PGM sample holder made of?

Carbon tape is used to affix the sample to the holder.

#### Are samples typically cooled?

In some beamlines there are provisions for cooling.

#### How does bremsstrahlung from the storage ring synchrotron radiation differ from that from electron-copper collision?

Cyclotron bremsstralung starts out as an accelerated charge. This creates an equivalent radiation pattern to a dipole oscillator. which creates a typical 

#### Why is an accelerating electron equivalent to a dipole?


#### Why, intuitively, does the bremsstralung light from an orbiting electron form a cone?

@Properties1994 has a great paragraph on this.

> Physically, the time compression is due to the fact that a highly relativistic electron  follows very closely behind the signals it emitted at eralier times. Moreover, the strength of the electric field at the boserver is proportional to the apparent transverse acceleration of the electron as seen by the observer, which will be large when the time compression is large.

When the electron comes directly towards the observer, its relative speed is maximal, and so its time is shifted by $\gamma$, and so the acceleration "on the" electron as percieved by the observer is magnified. Bremsstralung is 

#### Why then does the electron not also emit a cone *backwards*, when $\omega = 180$?



#### Is the input to the monochromator to the VLS-PGM from an insertion device or from the storage ring bremmsstralung alone?

There are 12 straight sections in the beamline with dipole bending magnets at the corners. Wouldn't be any bremsstralung from the straight sections, presumably.

Elliptically Polarizing Undulator


#### How does the undulator work? How is it different from a wiggler?

@VLSPGM2007a says it 

A wiggler and an undulator are apparently very similar in form and function. An undulator produces coherent light; the gaps between the waves are such that photons 

> Undulators and wigglers differ in the K parameter which can be interpreted as the ratio between the radiation divergence (∼ 1/γ)of adipole and the maximum deection angle of the charged particle (K/γ). For small K-values the light cones emitted at indivdual poles overlap and due to interference produce asharply peaked line spectrum with only afewharmonics. The harmonics are well separated and the on axis ux density isproportional to afactor between N and N 2 (depending on e-beam and beamline parameters), where Ndenotes the number of magnet periods. Wigglers havelar ge K-values. They produce hundreds to thousands of harmonics.
> @Insertion

> The frequency spread is $∼1/N_u%, due to the effect of truncated sinusoidal motion.

#### If undulators are coherent to the period between magnets, how are different spectra produced?

@Properties1994 eq. 12 discusses. 

$\lambda_u$ is the physical spacing of the undulator.

I'm not sure *why* this is, though. 

#### If the undulator uses fixed permanent magnets, how does it produce different wavelengths of x-rays as the input to the monochromator?

The gap width is adjusted. On electromagnet undulators this is done by altering the field strenth.

#### Why is the insertion device required? Why can't the SR bremmsstralung be used on its own?

> The vast majority of proposals for this new facility were based upon the radiation from insertion devices IDs and not from bending magnets.

#### For absorption measurements, how is fluroescence light filtered on the output photodiode?



#### What's the difference between RIXS and XAS?

Discussed by @XASa 

#### Why can't 'household' x-ray sources be used for XAS? Is XAS ever done in SEMs?

I have read that it is difficult to monochromate basic x-ray sources.

#### If relativistic charges instead radiated parallel to the acceleration, rather than in the direction of the velocity, would synchrotrons be possible?


#### How does the two-beam M1, M2 chicane work? 


#### Why does the VLS-PGM webpage say that TEY and FLY are "standard XAS"?

I am not sure if VLS-PGM has "straight-through" Beers law detector. TEY and FLY are both indirect methods of reading out the absorption spectrum, and might have different surface. 

> standard XAS measurements, where Total Electron Yield (TEY) and Total Fluorescence Yield (FLY) are recorded, the VLSPGM provide two alternative forms of data acquisition configurations: 

#### What's the difference between XAS and XPS?





#### What are the steps to get a result from XANES?


#### Some formulations use bras and kets. What does a basic quantum mechanical formulation of XAS with FLY look like?



#### What is "pink synchrotron light"?

#### Why are people allocated 8-hour blocks? What fraction of that 8 hours are samples in the load-lock and being analyzed? Does the 8-hours include time for sample prep?

Some experiments may require time- or condition- sensitive samples, e.g. without moisture. This would make it more reasonable to have block allocations of time.

#### Why are the M mirrors coated in carbon, and why is carbon tape used to fix samples?

In other situations, e.g. EXAFS, it's said that carbon contamination can be detrimental.

#### How is the photon flux adjusted?

In the manual for the TOF spectrometer, it is stated that the photon flux can be adjusted. How is this performed?

#### It is said that bremmstralung is quantized. This causes emittance growth in electron accelerators

Naturally; it is emitted in single photons. It is said that 

#### What is "the I0 mesh"?

A gold wire mesh of maybe 20 um can be placed before or after the sample; photoelectrons are emitted by the mesh. Unlike (?) when sample measurements are made,

#### Which definition of emittance is most commonly used at the CLS?

Emittance is "conserved area in phase-space".

#### In [@VLSPGM2007a], a graph of photon energy vs intensity for Helium is shown, and named the "double excitation spectrum". The first peak is at about 63 eV. Why is this different from the second ionization energy of helium?


#### Why does X-ray luminescence depend on color of material?

https://youtu.be/YT4ZtCCP31s

At 20:47, that video also has a great intro to EXAFS.



#### What's the difference between the classical mechancis Hamiltonian and the QM one?

I CM, the hamiltonian is T = H+V, i.e the total energy of the system (kinetic and hamiltonian). In QM, 


# Pitfalls and best practices, automated quality controls

Already we have our first issue. @close2015

Contamination of the gold mesh can lead to a decreased PE emission current.


In @Retraction2018, 

> The spectrum published in our PCCP paper is not consistent with backups of raw data from the beamline computer and it was thus modified while no specific data treatment is mentioned.
