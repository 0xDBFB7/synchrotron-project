RF power is produced by a "thermionic" generator. What is that? Klystron?

# Stats

Branch A has a ~0.3 mm beam width.

Branch B has a new KB focus system

> Typically, the duration of a 25eV scan is ~20 minutes

CLS is a "third generation" source.

# Resolving power

VLS-PGM stands for Variable Line Spacing Plane Grating Monochromator.

[@zuin2007early] describes the VLS-PGM beamline, and mentions that it has a "resolving power" of $10^4$. 

What does resolving power mean? [@XRay1991], page 311, chapter 9.5. 

This refers to the use of a plane crystal spectrograph. How does that relate to the VGS?

> The angular dispersion is different from the *resolving power*, $\lambda / d\lambda$, or *resolution*.

$\lambda / d\lambda = E/|dE|$

# Qs to be answered

#### what's the energy in this x-ray beam? 

Flux is between $10^12$ and $10^15$ photons/sec.

#### does the target get thermally damaged? Is ionization damage/dislocation a serious concern?

#### Is the beam pulsed? Are XAS techniques ever pulsed?

I don't see any provisions on the control panel for pulsed operation. There is a provision for a basic kind of synchronization. The beam is split into bunches.

#### What detectors do the VLS-PGM beamlines have?

1. Si photodiode that monitors the flux.
2. There's a simple spectrometer with a camera?
3. 
> VLS-PGM's Toroidal Spectrometer apparatus measures the angle, energy, and relative drift time of ions and electrons generated by the ionization of molecules by soft X-rays.

#### What detector is usually used for XAS?



#### How does bremsstrahlung from the storage ring synchrotron radiation differ from that from electron-copper collision?

Cyclotron bremsstralung starts out as an accelerated charge. This creates an equivalent radiation pattern to a dipole oscillator. which creates a typical 

#### Why is an accelerating electron equivalent to a dipole?


#### Is the input to the monochromator to the VLS-PGM from an insertion device or from the storage ring bremmsstralung alone?

There are 12 straight sections in the beamline with dipole bending magnets at the corners. Wouldn't be any bremsstralung from the straight sections, presumably.

#### How does the undulator work? How is it different from a wiggler?

A wiggler and an undulator are apparently identical. An undulator produces coherent light; the gaps between 

#### If the undulator uses fixed permanent magnets, how does it produce different wavelenghts of x-rays for the 

#### Why is the insertion device required? Why can't the SR bremmsstralung be used on its own?



#### If relativistic charges instead radiated parallel to the acceleration, rather than in the direction of the velocity, would synchrotrons be possible?


#### Why can't 'household' x-ray sources be used for XAS? Is XAS ever done in SEMs?

I have read that it is difficult to monochromate x-ray sources.

#### How does the two-beam chicane work? 



#### What's the difference between XAS and XPS?





#### What are the steps to get a result from XANES?

I'm realizing that, by learning via these proprietary book sources, I might be making it harder for people, especially those in low-income countries, to verify quotes &c.
